### **Description**
The world is a stressful place and sometimes we need help to navigate that. We created the app with this in mind, to help users regain a sense of calm by practicing meditation. Tranquili-T is a meditation app which helps users to be calm, relax, unwind and fosters resilience. App main features:
- Meditation timer. This is designed to help users to track the time in the meditation. Users can choose to meditate for 10, 15, and 20 minutes. 
- Inspiring quotes. In the home page, a quote is also displayed so that users can feel inspired and be motivated to push through the day. Users can also reflect on the quotes and use it to reframe their mindset. 
- Meditation tracker. This helps users to build a habit to meditate every day and be accountable to stay on top of their mental health.

### **Design**
The app has been designed using React Native with JavaScript. It is also connected to an external API (https://zenquotes.io/) to fetch inspirational quotes. We have implemented a minimalist design with straightforward features and buttons and easy navigation. The color scheme was carefully selected to be soothing and gentle colours that is easy on the eyes, especially as users will tend to use this app in the dark or with minimal lighting. App features also come in a nice color contrast considering the requirements of the non-neurotypical users such as ADHD and Dyslexia.
